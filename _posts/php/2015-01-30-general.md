In any of our new projects, modules and extensions we follow the [PSR-1 Basic Coding Standard](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/) and [PSR-2 Coding Style Guide](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/). However, not all projects we are working on are started from scratch. In general we try to stick to the coding style used around us. Consistency is most important.
