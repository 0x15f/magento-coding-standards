Comments should be added at the top of each component to indicate the purpose and use of the component. They should also be added
above a selector when appropriate to explain references to other elements/classes/components. These should use the // syntax. e.g.
{% highlight scss %}
//
// If a form-horizontal parent modifier class is assigned, 
// the form-list component changes to a horizontal layout 
// for viewports larger than small screens
//
.form-horizontal & {
    @include breakpoint(map-get($breakpoints, 'small')) {
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Sass mixins and functions should also be marked with annotations providing a description, any arguments and dependencies.
Sassdocs annotations are preferred.

For a Sass projects main file a table of contents should be added at the top of the file for reference of all partials
within the project. This should be updated whenever a partial is added e.g.

{% highlight scss %}
//
//  CONTENTS
// 
//  UTILITIES
//  Functions............Useful functions.
//  Mixins
//      Breakpoint.......Media query mixin.
//      Rem..............Conditionally output px or rem.
//      Before IE 10.....Conditionally output content for pre IE10.
//      Before IE 9......Conditionally output content for pre IE9.
//      Bourbon..........Bourbon Mixin library - See http://bourbon.io/docs/
