###Imports
**Never use inline imports**. For imports inside .scss files do not use underscores or filename extensions.

{% highlight scss %}
// Don't do this
@import '_form-list.scss';
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight scss %}
// Do this
@import 'form-list';
{% endhighlight %}

###Values
Reusable values should be stored in variables without a unit attached.

{% highlight scss %}
// Don't do this
$vertical-spacing: 20px;
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight scss %}
// Do this
$vertical-spacing: 20;
{% endhighlight %}

###Calculations
When performing Math in Sass always enclose them in parentheses.
{% highlight scss %}
// Don't do this
width: $container-width / 2;
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight scss %}
// Do this
width: ($container-width / 2);
{% endhighlight %}

###Maps
Maps should be used whenever values will be reused repeatedly. Common examples include breakpoints, colour groups and z-index values.
Maps should have the following syntax:

- Hyphenated name
- Single quoted keys
- Space after the colon
- Opening brace on same line as map name
- Key/Value pairs on same line
- Comma at end of each key/value pair except the last
- Closing brace on it's own line
 
{% highlight scss %}
$breakpoints: (
    'small': 30rem,
    'medium': 48.125rem,
    'large': 75rem
);
{% endhighlight %}

These can then be fetched through the map-get function:
{% highlight scss %}
map-get($breakpoints, 'small')
{% endhighlight %}

###Variable Naming
Names should not be based on buzzwords or physical objects. They should be developer friendly and understandable.
Colour names should be representative of themselves. If colour names are difficult to remember, additional variables
can be created that reference the original colours.

{% highlight scss %}
// Do this
$brand-colours: (
    'teal': #088,
    'royal-blue': #4169E1 
);

$divider-colour = map-get($brand-colours, 'teal');
{% endhighlight %}

###Nesting
Selector nesting should be kept as simplistic as possible. Attempting to be clever (although impressive) will make sass
harder to read and take longer to analyze. Nesting should also be kept to a maximum of 3 levels deep. If a selector needs to be 
more than 3 levels deep then refactoring is required. There is always a way to reduce the specificity and still target
the desired elements.

{% highlight scss %}
// Don't do this
.navigation {
    ul {
        >li {
            &:first-child {
                margin-left: 0;
            }
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight scss %}
// Be terse
.navigation-parent-item {
    &:first-child {
        margin-left: 0;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

###Animations, Mixins & Functions
Each mixin, function and animation should be separated out into it's own partial and documented using SassDoc annotations.

###Extend
@extend should be reserved for use on sass placeholders only.

###Sass Declarations
In sass rulesets declarations should be in the following order:

- Extends
- Includes without content
- Normal declarations
- Includes with content
- Nested rule sets

###Media Queries
Use an existing mixin for declaring a media query and place it nested inside the ruleset. This allows the developer
to easily find related media queries. Optimisation for duplicate media queries can be dealt with as a performance task.

{% highlight scss %}
.selector {
    @include linear-gradient(to bottom, #fff, #f2f2f2, $fallback: #fff);

    @include breakpoint(map-get($breakpoints, 'medium')) {
        background-color: inherit;
        background-image: none;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
