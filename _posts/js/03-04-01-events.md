Bear in mind, while developing, that other's will want to perform their own JavaScript logic which depends on your own. Of course, a developer could go into your own JavaScript file in the `skin/` directory and change your code, but a good developer would not want to do this since, among other reasons, it's not an upgrade-proof change. A developer could also overwrite this file in their theme, while this is slightly better, it still is not upgrade-proof.

We recommend using events in your classes so that developers can hook into them to implement their logic. In action:

{% highlight js %}
// Your class code
var MyFeature = Class.create();
(function() {
    MyFeature.prototype = {
        initialize: function() {
            document.fire('myfeature:before_initialize');
            // Do some stuff...
            document.fire('myfeature:after_initialize');
        },

        customMethod: function() {
            document.fire('myfeature:before_customMethod');
            // Do some stuff for customMethod...
            document.fire('myfeature:important_stuff')
            document.fire('myfeature:after_customMethod');
        }
    }
})();

// Observer code
$(document).observe('myfeature:important_stuff_happened', function() { 
alert('Important stuff just happened!'); 
});
{% endhighlight %}

The advantage here is that we don't need to overwrite any code to append our own logic. One important note is we donâ€™t need to use the document element, we can target some specific element; for example, in Meanbee Postcode, we might want to send out custom events on our postcode dropdown element.
