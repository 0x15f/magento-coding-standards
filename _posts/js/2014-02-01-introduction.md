We define Magento development into two broad categories. These are:

- Module development
- Theme development

Module development typically concerns some single, specific backend feature, which can be added as a component to a Magento store. Theme development is much more front end focused, and concerns the appearance of a Magento site. Both types of development can have JavaScript associated with them, so we break down this document here to discuss standard and best practice in both cases.
