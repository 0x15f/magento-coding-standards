When finishing a hotfix or a release, git flow will automatically create a tag. Once named it will also ask for a tag message.  We recommend this message to be a list of tickets and summaries of changes between the last tag and now, e.g.

    MB-123: Summary of the issue
    MB-124: Summary of the issue
    MB-125: Summary of the issue
    MB-126: Summary of the issue

If you're tagging a release manually, then please do so in the same way as you would have when creating a release branch, i.e. `yyyy.mm.dd`. If making more than one release on the same day, append a `-n` to the release version, for example `release/2014.02.13-2`.
